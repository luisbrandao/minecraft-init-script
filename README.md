## minecraft-init-script

by Luis Brand√£o <<techmago@ymail.com>>

This is an initscript to run a Minecraft CentOS.

forked from https://github.com/superjamie/minecraft-init-script

### Features

*   Start, stop, restart Minecraft as a system service
*   Automatic (via cron) and manual logfile rotation
*   Automatic (via cron) and manual backups
*   Backup compression and rotation (keeps 7 days worth of backups)
*   Allows use of third-party backup solutions
*   Check latest Recommended Build and update to it if required
*   Information display including Java path, current memory usage, current TCP connections
*   Able to run multiple separate instances of the server at once

### Supported Distributions

*   CentOS 7,  CentOS 6, CentOS 5, Fedora 14 (probably works on Fedora Core 6 and later, untested)
*   Ubuntu Server 12.04 LTS

Other distros which use SysV Init or Upstart will probably work.

Distros using systemd (Fedora 15+, Arch Linux, etc) may not work.

### Requirements

*   `screen`, `rsync`

    (you may need to install these)

*   `bash`, `chkconfig` or `sysv-rc`, `coreutils`, `cronie`, `curl`, `diffutils`, `grep`, `initscripts`, `net-tools`, `procps`, `tar`

  (these should all be installed by default)

*   Oracle Java 7

*   Enough disk space to save your map twice, plus another ~5 times for a week of compressed backup space.

  ie: If your map is 1Gb then you probably need at least 7Gb, plus any space your plugins require and any additional backups you'll be making.

### Installation

As the root user:

*   Install Sun Java (CentOS/Fedora)

    Download the RPM from <http://www.java.com/>

    `yum localinstall jre-<version>.rpm`

*   Install Sun Java (Ubuntu)

    ~~~
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install oracle-java7-installer
    ~~~

*   Confirm your JVM installation

    ~~~
    java -version
    ~~~

*   Save the script as `/etc/init.d/minecraft` and make it executable

    ~~~
    chmod +x /etc/init.d/minecraft
    ~~~

*   Copy between the `<<COMMENT` and `COMMENT` lines and place the copy at `/etc/default/minecraft`

    If you need to edit settings, edit the `/etc/default/minecraft` file, not the initscript


*   Create an alias so you only have to type `minecraft` to run the script

    Add the following line to both root and bukkit's `~/.bashrc` file:

    ~~~
    alias minecraft='/etc/init.d/minecraft'
    ~~~

*   Start the server on system boot if desired (CentOS/Fedora)

    ~~~
    chkconfig --add minecraft
    chkconfig minecraft on
    ~~~

*   Start the server on system boot if desired (Ubuntu)

    ~~~
    update-rc.d minecraft defaults
    ~~~

As the regular user, bukkit:

*   Make the required paths

    ~~~
    mkdir -p ~/backups && mkdir -p ~/craftbukkit
    ~~~

*   Put your `minecrat_server.jar`, world, plugins, `server.properties`, etc into `~/craftbukkit`

### Backups

*   Create cron jobs to do regular backups and rotations around 4am

    Type `crontab -e` to open the cron interface and add the following

    ~~~
    */5 * * * * /etc/init.d/minecraft time                # Say the time every 5 minutes
     0 4 * * * /etc/init.d/minecraft backup              # backup world at 4:00am
     5 4 * * * /etc/init.d/minecraft logrotate           # rotate logs at 4:05am
    15 4 * * * /etc/init.d/minecraft removeoldbackups    # remove old backups at 4:15am
    20 4 * * * /etc/init.d/minecraft restart             # restart server at at 4:20am
    ~~~

*   If you have multiple worlds, you can pass the worldname as a parameter to the regular backup

    ~~~
     0 4 * * * /etc/init.d/minecraft backup world1       # backup world1 at 4:00am
     5 4 * * * /etc/init.d/minecraft logrotate           # rotate logs at 4:05am
    15 4 * * * /etc/init.d/minecraft backup world2       # backup world2 at 4:15am
    30 4 * * * /etc/init.d/minecraft removeoldbackups    # remove old backups at 4:30am
    ~~~

*   If you wish to use a third-party backup solution, just disable world writes

    ~~~
    minecraft save-off
    ~~~

    Then run your backup tool. Then re-enable world writes

    ~~~
    minecraft save-on
    ~~~

### Multiple Instances

It is possible to run multiple instances, for example a Creative server and a Survival server, on the same system.

*   Copy the script to two new files

    ~~~
    cp /etc/init.d/minecraft /etc/init.d/minecraft-creative
    cp /etc/init.d/minecraft /etc/init.d/minecraft-survival
    ~~~

*   Edit the `Provides` section on Line 6 to the same as the new filename

    ~~~
    # Provides: minecraft-creative
    # Provides: minecraft-survival
    ~~~

*   Create a settings file for each instance in `/etc/default/` using the same name as the script

    ~~~
    /etc/default/minecraft-creative
    /etc/default/minecraft-creative
    ~~~

*   Set an alias for each server in `~/.bashrc`

    ~~~
    alias creative='/etc/init.d/minecraft-creative'
    alias survival='/etc/init.d/minecraft-survival'
    ~~~

*   Add the new scripts to `chkconfig` or `update-rc.d`

*   Set the paths of the separate maps in each script

    ~~~
    MCPATH="/home/bukkit/craftbukkit-creative"
    MCPATH="/home/bukkit/craftbukkit-survival"
    ~~~

*   Change your screen session names in each script

    ~~~
    SCRNAME="creative"
    SCRNAME="survival"
    ~~~

### Usage

*   Start the server

    ~~~
    minecraft start
    ~~~

*   Stop the server

    ~~~
    minecraft stop
    ~~~

*   Restart the server

    ~~~
    minecraft restart
    ~~~

*   Back up the map and executable

    ~~~
    minecraft backup
    ~~~

    The final compressed backup is done when the `.md5` file appears in the backup directory.

*   Back up multiple maps

    ~~~
    minecraft backup world1
    minecraft backup world2
    ~~~

*   Check the server is running

    ~~~
    minecraft status
    ~~~

*   Get some more info

    ~~~
    minecraft info

    * CraftBukkit (pid 9037) is running...

    ~~~

*   Broadcast a message to the server

    ~~~
    minecraft say
    ~~~

    Note that some punctuation like 'apostrophes' will not work.
